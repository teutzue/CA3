      <p>This Version of the Seed provides a Java JAX RS Backend and an Angular Frontend in one NetBeans Web Project</p>

      <div class="col-md-8">
        <ul>
          <li>As usual all Backend Code should be placed in the <em>Source Packages</em> Folder</li>
          <li>As usual all Client Code should be placed in the <em>Web Pages Folder</em> (in the sub-folder <b>app</b>)</li>
        </ul>

      <p>This should come as no surprise to you.</p> 
      <p>It's a basic NetBeans Web Project with a few Demo REST Services included  + support for Token-based Security</p>

        <p><em style="font-weight: bold">Note: The image reflects the "two project" version of the seed, which you should use when doing client-side testing. (6-8) is not relevant for this version</em></p>
        <p>The seed is built from <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed">AngularJSs</a> seed and the application skeleton of the seed is therefore heavily inspired by this seed.</p>
        <p>This seed is "twisted" to make it easier to use in a school, see this <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-best-practices-directory-structure">link</a> for alternative seed-structures.</p> 
        <p>All the content of the Site Root (an alias for the app-folder) is what makes up the web-application and is what will be copied to the "Web Pages" folder of the Server project whenever you perform a clean build or deploy this project.</p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li> Contains all dependencies for the web-application (Angular-files, etc.)  </li>
          <li> A folder with files for "global" filters, directives, factories and services. If you place code in one of these files you don't need do any "includes" but obviously things must still be injected to use them in your code </li>
          <li> All the Views for this application. Each folder must as a minimum include a template for the view and a routeprovider with the routing-details </li>
          <li> The app.js (your Java-main counterpart). Open the file to understand it's purpose</li>
          <li> index.html holds the top-menu and the <em>ng-view directive</em>. All external files are included here</li>
          <li>This is where you should place all Karma-unit tests for the project</li>
          <li>Configuration-files to setup all dependencies</li>
          <li>Right-click this icon to setup Karma defaults </li>
        </ol>

    <uib-accordion-group heading="Security Features in the Seed" >
      <h3>Setting up the Database</h3>
       <p>This version of the seed requires a database. Create a database and change persistence.xml to reflect your database, password etc.</p>
       <p>If you create a new persistence.xml, which often makes sence, make sure to use the same name, and include the "extra" persisten unit meant for OPENSHIFT</p> 
       <p>When this is done, your project should be ready for OPENSHIFT deployment without any problems</p>
      <h3>Test Users: (logon with these credentials to test authentication)</h3>
      <p>The Backend supports whatever roles you come up with. Out of the box the front-end only handles the roles "User" and "Admin". Adding more is however simple</p>
      <ul style="font-size: large">
        <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">User</b>username = user, password = test</li>
        <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">Admin:</b>username = admin, password = test</li>
        <li><b style="display: inline-block;width:7em;">User+Admin:</b>username = user_admin, password = test</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 style="color: red">MAKE SURE to remove the part that sets up test users in the class DeplymentConfiguration. Either manually, or via the flag in web.xml for a REAL system</h4>
      <h3>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Server:</em></h3>
     
      <p>Decorate your REST classes and or methods with theese annotations: <em>@PermitAll</em> <em>@DenyAll</em> <em>@RolesAllowed</em>
      <p>See the section Securing RESTful Web Services Using Annotations here: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/web.1211/e24983/secure.htm#RESTF256">Securing RESTful Web Services</a>
      <P>See The server package <b>rest</b> provides examples of services using both the <em>User</em> and <em>Admin</em> Roles</p>
      <p>Username, password, and roles are hardcoded in UserFacade.java and the User Class (your task is to place this info in a database)</p>

      <h3>Using the Security Features in this seed - <em>Client</em>:</h3>
      <p>Logon/logof is ready to use.</p>
      <p>A token with credentials is automatically attached to all outgoing AJAX (REST)requests (when you are logged on) </p>
      <p>In this version users can see all menu items (even if they do not have the necessary rights). This is for you to

        observe when and where security takes place (bring up F12 in chrome and monitor the network traffic)<p>
      <p>You can hide elements (menu-items) so they are only visible when logged on with the required security role. Add <code>ng-show="isUser"</code> to
        the "view2" anchor tag in index.html and <code>ng-show="isAdmin"</code> on the "view2" tag. To see this in action.</p>
      <p>Everything you do, that relates to security on the client, can be tampered with, so the trick above should be seen as
        something to make the system more user friendly. <span style="text-decoration: underline">The real security is how REST (our data) is protected on the server. </span>
      </p>
      <p>Security in this seed was inspired by these articles</p>
      <ul style="list-style: none">
        <li> <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/2014/01/07/angularjs-authentication-with-cookies-vs-token/">Cookies vs Tokens. Getting auth right with Angular.JS</a></li>

      </ul>
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="Adding new files">

      The single most import thing to realize about this, and all other, seeds is how "wirred up".
      <p>As an example, let's see what it will take to include a new view:</p>
      <p>Create a new folder for the view and create (as a minimum) an html-template and a JavaScript file with (as a minimum) the route-handling for the view. In this file provide a name as sketched below:</p>
      <p><code> angular.module('myApp.<b>nameForTheView</b>', ['ngRoute'])</code></p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold">Important:</p> 
      <ol>
        <li>Copy the text: 'myApp.nameForTheView' from the *.js-file into the <em>app.js-file</em> (just look into the file to see how)</li>
        <li>Important: include the file in index.html (just look into the file to see how all other js-files are included)</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now you can use your new view from anywhere in your application using the url you provided for the route-handling</p>
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="Removing Unnecessary Page/Code" >
      <p>Whenever you use a wizard or a seed as a starting point for your applications it is important to remove code not relevant for what you are doing.</p>
      <p>One thing you always will have to remove is the "Using the Seed"-view.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Delete the <em>view4-folder</em> and all its content.</li>
        <li>Remove the "injection" 'myApp.view4' in <em>app.js </em></li>
        <li>Remove the script-include in the file <em>index.html</em> </li>
        <li>Remove the "menu-entry" in <em>index.html</em></li>
      </ol>
    </uib-accordion-group>
    <uib-accordion-group heading="Client Side Testing" >
      <p><em style="font-weight: bold">Note: This version of the seed does not support (out of the box) Client Side Karma testing. Clone the the "two project" version of the seed for this </em></p>
      <p>The seed ships with a number of built in tests to demonstrate Karma-testing </p>
      <h4>Running the Tests</h4>
      <p><b>Before you start</b> Right Click the Karma-icon (<img src="app/view4/image/karma.PNG">) and select properties. Make sure the Karma and Configuration folders are set correctly (pointing to something on your file system). If not press the <em>Search</em> button. If should find and set the correct folder.
      <p><b>To run the Tests</b> Right Click the <em>AngSeedClient</em> project and select Test. This will start (default only Chrome) a browser to run your tests. REMEMBER these are client side tests and they execute in a browser </p>
      <p><b>Before you start</b> Right Click the Karma-icon (<img src="app/view4/image/karma.PNG">) and select Stop</p>
      <h4>Where is the Test Code</h4>
      <p>In this seed all test code are placed in a separate Test-folder (test, with the alias Unit Tests) </p>
      <p>If you follow the suggested naming strategy for views (viewXX) your tests should be executed automatically</p>
      <p>If your test-code is not being recognized, open the <em>karma.conf</em>-file to see how to point to tests and the things we test </p>

    </uib-accordion-group>
      <uib-accordion-group heading="Backend Testing" >
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The seed ships with an embedded HTTP and Servlet container, called: <img src="view4/image/Jetty_logo.png" alt="" width="100px"/></p>
          <p>Jetty is designed to be a software component that can be instantiated and used in a Java program just like any POJO. </p>
          <p>In this context, we use the Jetty server for running our backend REST tests.</p>
          <h4>Installing</h4>
          <p>Jetty Jar file can be found on these links: (this seed uses 9.2)<a href=""></a></p>
          <ul>
              <li><b><a href="http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all/9.3.5.v20151012/">> 9.3: </a></b> Can be used if you are running your code with Java version 8 and onwards</li>
              <li><b><a href="http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/aggregate/jetty-all/9.2.9.v20150224/">< 9.2:</a></b> Can be used if you are running your code with Java version 7 and prior</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We include Jetty in the "Compile Test" section of the library properties, in order for the server not to be included in the final build.</p>
          <img src="app/view4/image/backendTestProperties.png" width="50%"/>
          <h4>Testing</h4>
          <p>In order for Jetty to work we need to start the server before we use our jUnit tests</p>
          <img src="app/view4/image/backendTest.png" alt="" width="80%"/>
          <ol class="list"> 
              <li>Creates a new server instance with the port number 8082</li>
              <li>Make a context where the servlet is served from (here /api) and attach the ServletHolder described in 3.</li>
              <li>Creates a ServletHolder that utilizes the Jersy library for handling servlets</li>
              <li>Attach the ContextHandler to the server and starts the server.</li>
              <li>In the tear down, then shut down the server, and wait for all the threads are terminated before returning</li>
          </ol>
